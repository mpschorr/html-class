            lol)</li>

            Documents / foot)</li>
        <li>If it says "This directory does not appear to be a Git repository" (it should), click "create a repository"
        </li>

            and make sure "Initialize with a README" is
            unchecked and "Git ignore" and "License" are set to None</li>

            "added weird crescent flag" or "uploaded files")</li>

            Confirm</li>

        <li>Go back to the github.io page with your username and make the end of the path the name of your folder (like
